# USART1.c
Input : A = led blink delay 2 sec
Input : B = led blink delay 1 sec


# USART2.c
Input : on = led on
Input : off = off


# blink3twoSec3threeSecOn.c
=> 3 times blink with 2 sec delay
=> 2 times blink with 3 sec delay
=>permenantly on

# internal.c
=> Input : C = led on
=> Input : E = led off
=> also calculate timer1 for 0.2 sec delay

# Keil1.c
=>when INT0 enabled factorial of 6 should be find
